## 🤖 E-commerce Dataset Analysis – Part 3: Predicting Customer Preferences (Classification Modeling)

This final part of the project demonstrates my ability to build and evaluate **machine learning models** to predict user preferences in an e-commerce setting. The task involves binary classification: predicting whether a user will **like (1)** or **dislike (0)** an item, based on transaction and product features.

### 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal is to use customer and product data to predict **binary ratings** (like/dislike) using classification models. The approach includes:

- Exploratory data analysis and cleaning
- Feature encoding and transformation
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning and performance comparison
